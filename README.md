# Code-Smell-Class-Activity

This repository contains files with code smells, your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to refactor the code with your group.


# Activity overview:
- Clone the respository to one of the computers on your group.
- Use one computer in a pair-programming fashion to refactor the code collaboratively.
- Each refactored snippet should be on a separate branch.
- Commit and Push Changes and crate a pull request.
- We will review pull requests together as a class.
