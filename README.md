# Code-Smell-Class-Activity

This repository contains files with code smells, your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to refactor the code with your group.


# Activity overview:
- Clone the respository to one of the computers on your group.
- Use one computer in a pair-programming fashion to refactor the code collaboratively.
- Each refactored snippet should be on a separate branch.
- Commit and Push Changes and crate a pull request.
- We will review pull requests together as a class.

# Assessment:
1. Code Smell Identification: Did you identify the correct code smells in the provided snippets?
2. Commit History: Are the commits meaningful, with clear and descriptive messages?
3. Pull Request Quality: Is the PR well-documented, with an explanation of what code smells were addressed and how the code was refactored?
4. Peer Feedback: Did students provide useful feedback during the peer review phase?

# Pull-Request template:
- Title: Brief but descriptive title of what the PR accomplishes.
- Description: Detailed explanation of the changes made, why they were necessary, and how they address specific issues.
- Changes Made: Provides a comparison of the code before and after the refactoring to show exactly what was changed.
- Testing: Describes how the changes were tested to ensure they work correctly and do not introduce new bugs.
- Related Issues: Links the PR to any relevant issues or tickets in the issue tracker.
- Additional Notes: Any extra information that might be useful for reviewers.
- Screenshots (if applicable): Visual aids to illustrate changes, if relevant.
